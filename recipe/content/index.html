            The Basque Burnt Cheesecake is a creamy and caramelized dessert that's easy to make. This cheesecake is the alter ego to the classic New York style cheesecake with a press-in cookie crust. Inspired by a Basque version, this is the cheesecake that wants to get burnt, cracked, and cooked at high heat. Which also means this is the cheesecake that's impossible to mess up.

            <li><strong>Serving Size:</strong> Serves 6</li>
            <li><strong>Special Equipment:</strong> A 10"-diameter springform pan.</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter (for pan)</li>
            <li>2 lb. cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1½ cups sugar</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Sherry (for serving; optional)</li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> 1 hour 15 minutes (10 min prep + 65 min cook)</li>
            <li><strong>Serving Temperature:</strong> Room temperature</li>
            <li><strong>Leftover Storage:</strong> Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Do Ahead:</strong> Cheesecake be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill. Be sure to let cheesecake sit for several hours at room temperature to remove chill before serving.</li>
            <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 400°. Butter pan, then line with 2 overlapping 16x12" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2" above top of pan on all sides.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake.</li>
