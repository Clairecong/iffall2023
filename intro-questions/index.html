        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <p>1. My name is Congyu Li. I am pursuing my master's degree in landscape architecture. I am in my last year of MLA2.</p>
        <p>2. I am interested in interaction/communication design. I have used WIX to make a website but basically have no background in web design. I would love to explore more by learning these skill sets! </p>
        <p>3. I unfortunately have no prior experience with HTML/CSS//JS.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn some coding basics to help me develop a web page related to interaction design. </p>
        <p>5. Design for screen gives the user more freedom to intereact with elements and seek for information than design for paper.</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://www.adobe.com/" >Adobe</a> 's website is a visually appealing website that meets its product functinality, and this website effectively showcases its various creative software products while providing multimedia elements to engage and educate visitors.</p>
        <p>7. I think <a href="https://www.Airbnb.com/" >Airbnb</a> 's website effectively communicates information about rental listings, hosts, and booking details. It uses high-quality images and user reviews to help users make informed decisions.</p>
        <p>8. I thinl <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/" >Google Earth</a> 's website has a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. Google Earth provides a wealth of geographic information, including satellite imagery, 3D terrain models, and street-level photography. This comprehensive data allows users to explore virtually any place on Earth.</p>
