                <p style="font-size: 12px">"Since I have returned to China and my hometown, of course, I want to sing a song with some Chinese characteristics. 'Drenched' was created by me at the end of last year. Some friends felt that the melody had a Chinese charm. It had been sung in many places around the world before, and I also hope that it can receive recognition from the people of my hometown."</p>

                <p class="verse">[Verse 1]</p>
                When minutes become hours
                When days become years
                And I don't know where you are
                Color seems so dull without you

                <p class="verse">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
                Have we lost our minds? What have we done?
                But it all doesn't seem to matter anymore

                <p class="verse">[Chorus]</p>
                When you kissed me on that street
                I kissed you back
                You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
                You picked me up to lay me down
                When I look into your eyes
                I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you
                And I, I'm drenched in your love
                I'm no longer able to hold it back

                <p class="verse">[Verse 2]</p>
                Is it too late to ask for love?
                Is it wrong to feel right?
                When the world is winding down
                Thoughts of you linger around

                <p class="verse">[Pre-Chorus]</p>
                Have we lost our minds? What have we done?
                But it all doesn't seem to matter anymore

                <p class="verse">[Chorus]</p>
                When you kissed me on that street
                I kissed you back
                You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
                You picked me up to lay me down
                When I look into your eyes
                I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you
                And I, I'm drenched in your love
                I'm no longer able to hold it back

                <p class="verse">[Chorus]</p>
                When you kissed me on that street
                I kissed you back
                You held me in your arms, I held you in mine
                You picked me up to lay me down
                When I look into your eyes
                I can hear you cry for a little bit more of you
                And I, I'm drenched in your love
                I'm no longer able to hold it back
